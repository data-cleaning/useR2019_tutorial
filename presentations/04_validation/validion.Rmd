## Try the code

\centering\huge

`03valid/make_valid.R`


## Data validation

Verify that data satisfy technical restrictions and does not contradict
expert knowledge.


### Examples of technical demands

- Number of records must equal 60
- Financial variables are numeric
- Records have a unique `id`
- Zipcode consists of 4 numbers followed by 2 letters 

### Examples of domain knowledge demands

- turnover is nonnegative
- turnover $-$ costs $=$ profit
- profit not larger then 60\% of turnover
- average profit is larger than 0
- average profit differs less than 10% from last year's average

## Data validation rules

A domain specific language to express demands.

### Why?

- Communicate data quality without ambiguities
- Make knowledge explicit and organize it
- Create custom data quality reports
- Reuse ruleset for data cleaning purposes

### How?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(validate)
companies <- read.csv("02input/input.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
rules     <- validator(mean(profit) > 0, turnover >= 0)
result    <- confront(companies, rules)
```



## Data validation: informal definitions

### Data validation

Check if a value, or combination of values is in a certain set
of valid values or valid value combinations.

### Data validation language in `validate`

Any R expression that results in a `logical`.
