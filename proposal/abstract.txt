Statistical data cleaning using R

Proposal for a 3 hour workshop on statistical data cleaning.

Mark van der Loo and Edwin de Jonge, Statistics Netherlands


Abstract.

To trust the outcome of a statistical analyses, one must be able to trust the
input data. 

In this workshop we demonstrate how data quality can be systematically defined
and improved using R. The workshop focuses on data validation (data checking),
locating errors, and imputing missing or erroneous values under restrictions.
We present short introductions to the main principles, provide quizzes and
discussions for the audience, and give short R-based exercises. We will
demonstrate a number of our R packages including 'validate' (for data quality
checks) 'errorlocate' (for error localizationi), 'simputation' for imputaton
methods and 'lumberjack' (for keeping track of changes in data).  Special
attention will be payed on how to combine the various data processing steps,
and how to analyze and visualize the results.

This tutorial is based on the book 'Statistical Data Cleaning with Applications
in R' (Wiley & Sons, 2018) by the authors of this tutorial.
